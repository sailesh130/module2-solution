		<h2 id="C">Chicken</h2>
		<p>Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.</p>

		<h2 id="M">Mutton</h2>
		<p>Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1] lamb curry,[2] or goat curry,[3][4] Indonesian: kari kambing or gulai kambing) is an Indian curry dish that is prepared from Goat Meat (or sometimes Lamb meat ) and vegetables.[5] Mainly popular in the Bengal region, the dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of South Asia.Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly saut√©ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The slow cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with raji, a cereal.[8]</p>

It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]</p>
